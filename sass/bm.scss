* Ok. Maybe this is a Pattren Library.
* But fundamentally this is a great package we developed for the new company website styles.
* We decided to share it because maybe it's useful for any new project, because we love your feedback and also to grow togheter
* We started to develope it, just based on our website needs so, feel free to use, change and add any new feature you need inside. 
* One important thing is that we do not support if there is a bug or something like this. 
* We hope you contribute, maybe make a pull request and so on. We still updating the library based on our website upgrades also.
*
* To use it, simply include the css file and enjoy it!
